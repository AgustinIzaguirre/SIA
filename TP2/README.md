# Neural Networks

This is a neural networks project. This directory contains some basic algorithms to train perceptrons to learn the AND and OR bitwise operations. The architecture of the perceptrons can be configured with the `architecture.conf` file.

Under the `TerrainNeuralNetwork` directory is a more advanced algorithm to train a more general neural network.
